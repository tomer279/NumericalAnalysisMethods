# NumericalAnalysisMethods
Numerical analysis methods for a university course. 
Suggestions for improving my code are welcome.

CAUTION: The code in these files is old, outdated, and not written properly. 
I'm working on improving and updating the code, adding more numerical methods, and making it more readable and Pythonic.
